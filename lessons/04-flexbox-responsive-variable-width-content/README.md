# Create a Landing Page with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Use Flexbox to Responsively Layout Variable-Width Content

> See how to use flexbox to layout variable-width content in columns, and take advantage of `justify-content` to keep flex children center-aligned on smaller viewports. We'll also learn how `margin` can be applied to resolve for lack of a well-supported `gap` property in flexbox. At the end of the lesson, we'll have styled both the "Subscribe" section and the site footer.

## Development Scripts

**`npm run develop`**

> Serve with hot reload at localhost:1337

**`npm run build`**

> Generate minified, autoprefixed CSS for production

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.

**`npm run serve`**

> Serve latest build files at localhost:1337
