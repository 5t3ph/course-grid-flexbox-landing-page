# Create a Landing Page with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Use CSS Grid to Create Layout Columns

> Apply grid layout and see when it's necessary to break out a media query to overcome grid's lack of wrapping behavior. We'll also learn about a property that grid and flexbox share: `align-items`.

## Development Scripts

**`npm run develop`**

> Serve with hot reload at localhost:1337

**`npm run build`**

> Generate minified, autoprefixed CSS for production

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.

**`npm run serve`**

> Serve latest build files at localhost:1337
