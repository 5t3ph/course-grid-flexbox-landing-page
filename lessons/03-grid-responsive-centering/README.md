# Create a Landing Page with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Responsively Center an Image and Caption with CSS Grid

> Grid offers us the easiest method to responsively center content. We'll use the grid property `place-content` to center the contents of `figure` to showcase our fictional product in use. Additionally, we'll learn about `object-fit` which is a modern technique that allows inline images to scale responsively within defined dimensions without distortion.

## Development Scripts

> Serve with hot reload at localhost:1337

**`npm run build`**

> Generate minified, autoprefixed CSS for production

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.

**`npm run serve`**
