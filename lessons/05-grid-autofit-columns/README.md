# Create a Landing Page with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Use CSS Grid auto-fit For Responsive Column Layout

> We'll complete our landing page styles by using CSS grid `auto-fit` in conjunction with the grid functions `repeat` and `minmax`. The result will be a responsive column layout that wraps when content shrinks below the minimum acceptable width. We'll also see how grid and flexbox can be used together by using flexbox to align the content of grid items. Finally, we'll view the fully completed landing page and reflect on how and why grid and flexbox were each used.
